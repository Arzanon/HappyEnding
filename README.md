# HAPPY ENDING ON BASE

In Base we cheer, a joyous end is near!

As the Base network has begun to expand, various meme communities have also started to rise up. Beyond their individual goals, they share a common aim of promoting the adoption and growth of the network. $HAPPY is a celebration of this meme-ecosphere and, at the same time, a promise that no matter what happens, we will witness a Happy Ending.

## GOALS
$HAPPY aims to promote meme culture on Base by encouraging the creation of art and projects that incorporate the meme-coin art style and their various quirks and gimmicks. To achieve this goal, $HAPPY applies a 0.1% sales tax, which is immediately transferred to a marketing wallet. Collected funds will be used for community events, reward programs, and advertising $HAPPY to the wider public. Any fees collected from trading with available liquidity pools (0.3%) will also be used for this purpose. Furthermore, any first-party promoted artwork will explicitly avoid the use of AI, in order to encourage and support artists during these challenging times.

## TRANSPARENCY
Meme coins tend to be closely associated with scams and rug pulls. $HAPPY hopes to counter this stereotype by being as open and transparent as possible. The team has invested significant effort to ensure that the contract passes all security checks provided by scanners like Go+, QuickIntel and TokenSniffer. Moreover, the entire development history and current state of the contract are available on GitHub. To demonstrate the team's dedication to the project, 95% of the entire token supply has been provided as liquidity, and 1% has been immediately transferred to the marketing wallet. The liquidity pools have been locked for two years, with our intention to continue this lock or even consider burning the LP tokens if the project takes off. We hope that these steps will solidify $HAPPY as a reliable project that pushes the Base ecosystem forward.

## THE TEAM
We are a group of enthusiastic visionaries who see a promising future in the Base network and cryptocurrency/blockchain technology as a whole. We are also the dankest of memers and appreciate the unique meme culture that is forming in the crypto community. $HAPPY is our investment in this future, and we hope you will join us on this journey!
